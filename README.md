# ColdEdge cryo auto manifold driver

The aim of this project is to create a driver for remote interface with Arduino-based auto manifold of cryostats from ColdEdge.
The communication relies on SCPI commands.

This project is based on Lachlan Gunn' [Open Instrument Control](https://github.com/LachlanGunn/oic) and ColdEdge AutoCool_v1.35
